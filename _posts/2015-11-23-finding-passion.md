If you don't know where the title of this post is coming from, I highly suggest you waste about a minute of your day by watching this video: [Shia LaBeouf "Just Do It" Motivational Speech (Original Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXsQAXx_ao0). 

Once you've watched that, now on to the rest of the post!

For three years of my high school career, I was super into playing lacrosse. Photographic evidence is below: 

![Me running for my life](https://scontent-iad3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xfa1/v/t1.0-9/541008_3634297981333_778678036_n.jpg?oh=dd05e444bbdee13dcbe29a2753efff00&oe=56F4D4D3)

My high school took playing lacrosse really seriously. My senior year, we sent something like ~11 kids to go play D1 lacrosse. And for a while, I thought I was going to play competitively in college, too. 

But then, I tore my ACL. I had forgone any sort of D1 or D3 recruitment, since I knew I wanted a more traditional college experience. That being said, I still wanted to play club ball. With my ACL basically half existent, I knew that the possibility of that happening was even less existent than the rest of my ACL. 

So, I decided to look for an alternative, and I ultimately chose to do a cappella instead. 

*Wait...what?*

**Why...**

*How..?*

What, you don't see the totally logical transition from lacrosse player to a cappella savior (Not really savior, but the word rhymes and is kinda cool, so I chose it.)?? 

Around my junior year of high school, one of my closest friends got super into writing his own raps. I would definitely link him on here, but let's just say he hasn't been discovered by Dr. Dre yet. 

Regardless, during lunch our whole friend group would be hanging out, and he'd come through with a rap and ask someone to drop a beat for him to rap over. At the time, I wasn't particularly good, but I was always willing to perform. 

I enjoyed the ability to make my own music anytime, anywhere, so I kept up with beatboxing. 

After having seen the show The Sing Off, and especially paying close attention to the group that won the third season ([Pentatonix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsVeQnBmp70)), I knew that I wanted to perform with an a cappella group in college. The question that I had to ask myself was....which one? 

Once I was set on going to Illinois, I started to look for a cappella groups to join. I eventually came across this one group called [No Comment](http://nocommentacappella.com) that looked absolutely legit. They went all the way to finals of the International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella, which is the competition that Pitch Perfect is based off (*yes, it's a real competition*). Even cooler thoguh was that Zedd retweeted their cover of Clarity.

I was sold that this was the group that I wanted to join. 

Fast forward to the first week of freshman year, I auditioned for the group. After going through a couple of rounds of auditions and learning a song with them, I was lucky enough to get into the group!

Being in No Comment has definitely been one of my favorite organizations that I'm involved with on campus. It's given me some awesome friends, but even more importantly, it has allowed me to discover and pursue what has turned out to be one of my favorite hobbies/pasttimes/passions. 

Beatboxing has become a big part of my life. I'm almost always beatboxing when I'm listening to music, not listening to music, doing homework, not doing homework...you get the drift. 

Most importantly, beatboxing has been one of my biggest stress-releases, very similar to what lacrosse once was. 

So, I guess the point of all of this is: don't be afraid to find your passion! In the words of the great Shia LaBeouf - JUST DO IT.
