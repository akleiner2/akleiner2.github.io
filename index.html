            <h3> Hey! I'm Allen. </h3>
            <p>
                I'm a senior product engineer at <a href="http://segment.com">Segment</a>, where I'm building experiences that help people understand and get the most value out of the Segment app.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've previously spent time at <a href="https://impira.com">Impira</a> and <a href="https://pinterest.com">Pinterest</a>, where I've worked on everything from web and developer infrastructure to growth engineering.
            </p>
            <p>
                My engineering interests are currently rooted in building end-to-end product experiences, and automating away as much developer friction as possible.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I'm not at work, you can find me watching sports with friends (NBA, NFL, and tennis), trying out a new beer, or reading up on the latest happenings in tech.
            </p>
